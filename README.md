# Parallax-Engine
Unity Project for 2.5d Parallax RPG Engine



## Notes To Remember TODOs
### Tile Replacements / Credits
* Switch grass & tree tiles / find credit for them
* Same with rocks/misc. minor decorations

### Tile Additions / Edits
* Sand for Beach
* Beach Water / Shore

### Tile object coding
* Reflections on ice, still water, etc.
* Slide on ice
* Ice ramps?
* Sand ramps / landslides?
* Prefab tiles should properly place tiles in full space
* Jump ledges

### Map Managing Code
* Buttons calling to methods (maybe static) to create new layers above/below (also delete top/bottom layer)
* Buttons for static functions to load/save maps as well
* New layers could be full or empty by default? Nice to have
* Map object stores map size? background music
* Nice to have - brush code for water / terraforming - automatically apply correct tiles to multiple layers, add/delete layers dynamically
* Detection for while on water or near water looking at edges

### Eventing Code
* Look into tasks/jobs instead of coroutines
* Proper movement restrictions
* Diagonal movement... maybe
* Consider what script sprite appearance and layer handling is owned by... moveable object may not make the most sense
* Better way to find current map in MoveableObject
* Player should be child of map?
* When a flag gets set as a side effect temporarily, rather than turn it off after, it should reset to it's previous status
* Weird visual overlap with objects on up layer as player moves down to lower layer

### Other things to do
* Region map - Melanite Style, LoP Region Concept
* Improve comments / documentation in code
* Message system - UI should have separate border / fill elements so opacity can be set differently
* Consider white outlines on characters / events

### Mechanics
* Level caps -> Store excess XP
* Additional pokedex info / research levels like in arceus



## Ideas
### Map Regions
* Dragon area as beautiful valleys, white stone, green grass, maybe some brown mountain mixed in or as caves. Rive/lake that is a dragon shap with island cave?
* Rome/Greece area should have fall colors
* Bamboo in dark mountain caves exterior
